## Introduction

> The theory suggests a whole new way of understanding the role of positive emotions in our lives. They´re not just fleeting feelings that come and go without consequence. They´re integral to out cognitive functioning, out social relationships and our overall wellbeing. ==Positive emotions are the fuel that drives the engine of human flourishing.== [p. 8]

> Now, I could see another way Fredrikson´s theory suggests that positive emotions change the way our brains operate. Step one, is feeling better. Step two is doing more of what matters to us. [p. 8]

> First, feeling good boosts our energy. [p. 9]

> Second, feeling good reduces stress. [p. 10]

> Because third, feeling good enriches your life. [p. 12]


# Part 1 | Energize
## Chapter 1: Play

### Create an Adventure

**Experiment 1: Choose Your Character**

> 1. The Collector loves to gather and organize, enjoying activities like searching for rare plants, or rummaging around in archives or garage sales.
> 2. The Competitor enjoys games and sports and takes pleasure in trying their best and winning.
> 3. The Explorer likes to wander, discovering new places and things they´ve never seen, through hiking, road tripping and other adventures.
> 4. The Creator finds joy in making things, and can spend hours every day drawing, painting, making music, gardening and more.
> 5. The Storyteller has an active imagination and uses their imagination to entertain others. They´re drawn to activities like writing, dance, theatre and role-playing games.
> 6. The Joker endeavours to make people laugh, and my play by performing stand-up, doing improv, or just pulling a lot of pranks to make you smile.
> 7. The Director likes to plan, organize and lead activities from directing stage performances to running a company, to working in political or social advocacy.
> 8. The Kinesthete finds play in physical activities like acrobatics, gymnastics and free running. [p. 28]

**Experiment 2: Embrace Your Curiosity

> Harnessing your curiosity is the second method for building adventure into your life. Curiosity doesn't simply make our lives more enjoyable. It also allows us to focus longer. [.p.30]

> I often think of my life as containing a series of *side quests*. Every day as I sit down to work, I look at my calendar and to-do-list and ask myself: "What's today's side quest going to be?" [p. 31]

> By adding *side quest* to your day, you create space for curiosity, exploration and playfulness - and could discover something amazing and totally unexpected along the way. [p. 31]

### Find the Fun

**Experiment 3: The Magic Post-It Note**

> 'What would this look like if it were fun?' has now become a guiding question in my life. And it´s surprisingly easy to draw upon. Think of a task you want to do right now, and ask what would it look like if it were fun? Could you do it in a different way? Could you add music, or a sense of humour, or get creative? What if you set out to do the task with friends, or promised yourself a treat at the end of the process?
> 	Is there a way to make this draining process a little more enjoyable? [p. 35]

**Experiment 4: Enjoy the Process, Not the Outcome**

> The pioneer of the study of 'flow' - that state in which we´re so immersed in a task that the rest of the world seems to melt away - Csikszenmihalyi first developed his theories while watching climbers in the Alps as a teenager. Csikszenmihalyi argued that if we can learn to focus on the process, rather than the outcome, we´re sumstantially more likely to enjoy the task. [p.37]

### Lower the Stakes

> Studies on humans, though blessedly less nasty than the ones on animals, have ound similar results. Children are more likely to play when they are´re in a comfortable, non-threatening environment. And studies of adults in the workplace have found that the feeling of relaxation promotes playful behaviours, as well as promoting creativity and wellbeing [p. 39]

**Experiment 5: Reframe Your Failure**

> No failure is ever just a failure. It´s an invitation to try something new. [p. 43]

**Experiment 6: Don´t Be Serious. Be Sincere.**

> If you were approaching a difficult project at work sincerely rather than seriously, you might focus on the process of completing each task, rather than becoming focused on the end result. you might also seek out the input and collaboration of others, rather than trying to tackle the project on your own. By doing these things, you may find it´s easier to approach it in the spirit of play, and that you´re better able to stay focused and motivated throughout. [p. 45]

## Chapter 2: Power

> Some might see the word 'Power' and think 'That's not me'.
> 
> If you´re one of those people, I want you to start thinking differently about power. When McCord used the wor, she meant a sense of personal empowerment: the sense that your job is in your control, your life is in your hands, and the decisions about your future are yours alone. This power isn´t something that we exert on others: it´s something we feel, the energy that makes us want to shuot from the rooftops: 'I can do it' [p.51-52]

### Boost Your Confidence

**Experiment 1: The Confidence Switch**
> My favorite method involves hat I call 'flipping the confidence switch'; in other words, challenging yuorself to behave as if you´re confident in your task, even if you´re not. [p. 57]


**Experiment 2: The Social Model Method

### Level Up Your Skills

>Learning through doing is one of the most powerful forces in human psychology. It´s the second key strategy if we´re to build our sense of power. Why? Because the more we do something, the greater our sense of control. We learn. We level up our skills. Our confidence grows. And we empower ourselves. [p. 63]

**Experiment 3:  The Shoshin Approach**


> It might sound odd that adopting a beginner's mind helps you become more of an expert in that field. Surely a beginner is someone why, by definition, has no idea what they are doing? However, shoshin can have a remarkable impact precisely because it allows us to see things afresh [p. 64]

>By letting go of the idea that we know everything, or somehow shuold, we actually feel more powerful. In this way, shoshin can help us approach challenges with a greater sense of curiosity, humility and resilience - and help as learn. [p. 65]

**Experiment 4: The Protégé Effect

> And if you´re concerned that you´re not 'qualified' enough to teach someone else, it´s worth remembering that the people we lear from best are often the ones who are just a step ahead of us in the journey, So anyone can become a teacher.
> 	You don´t need to be a guru. You can just be a guide. [p. 68]

### Take Ownership of Your Work

> Our need for control is why we love to decorate our bedrooms when we´re kids (or design our homes as adults) [p. 70-71]

**Experiment 5: Own The process**
> There ´s almost always a way for us to own the process of the task, even when outcome has been determined by someone else. [p. 73]


**Experiment 6: Own Your Mindset**

> But then I overheard a patient in another bay talking to her husband.. She was gushing about how wonderful her experience of hospital had been and how grateful. she was for the doctors and nurses looking after her. It made me pause. I was about to use me medical training and practical skills to put in an IV line, so that we could give a young lady, twelve weeks prgnant with her first child, fluids overnight to help with her nausea. It was to make her feel much better. And it was going to help the baby growing inside her as well. [p. 75]


> Wondering around with a frown and thinking, 'Why do i have to do this?' was a decision. And i could decide to think about it in another way. 'I choose to do this' , I could tell myself. 'I get to do this'. 'Or even, 'I´m blessed to do this' [p. 76]

## Chapter 3: People

### Find Your Scene

> Eno had discovered the genius of the collective scene. Or, as he called it, *scenius*. [p,  82]

#### Experiment 1: The Comrade Mindset

#### Experiment 2: Find Synchronicity

### Feel the Helper´s High

#### Experiment 3: Random Acts of Kindness

#### Experiment 4: Ask for Help from Others

> The helper´s high also shows us that asking for help from others can actually be a gift to them, rather than the burden we usually assume it will be [p. 90]

> This concept is today known as *[[Benjamin Franklin effect]]*. It suggests that when we ask someone for help, it´s likely to make them think better of us. It's the flipside of the transformative effects of helping others: we can ask others to help us, which will help them feel better, too. [p.91-92]

> [...] people are more eager to help than you think, [p. 92]

> Second, frame the request in the right way. In particular, do your best to ask for help in person. Asking virtually makes everything more difficult. [p. 92]

> [...] make sure you´re using the right language. [p. 93]

### Overcommunicate

#### Experiment 5: Overcommunicate the Good

> The first tactic for overcommunicating the good, then, is to share positive news - and to react to positive news in an energising way. This helps both the sharer and the responder. For the sharer, the simple act of sharing positive news increases positive emotions and psychological wellbeing. For the responder, experessing pride and happiness in the other person´s accomplishment fuels a positive interaction and bolsters the relationship [p.95]

#### Experiment 6: Overcommunicate the Not-So-Good

# Part 2 | Unblock

## Chapter 4: Seek Clarity

### The Fog of Uncertainty

> Often, the reason we don´t make a start is because we don´t know what we´re supposed to be doing in the first place . A mystifying fog has set around us. I call it the fog of uncertainty. [p.111]

### Ask 'Why?'

#### Experiment 1: Using Commander´s Intent

#### Experiment 2: The Five Whys

### Ask 'What?'

#### Experiment 3: NICE Goals

**Near Term**

**Input-based**

**Controllable**

**Energising**

#### Experiment 4: The Chrystal Ball Method

### Ask 'When?'

#### Experiment 5: Implementation Intentions

> These little triggers to action are called *implementation intentions*. And the science and behaviour change indicates they can be revolutionary. [p.129]

> If you decide beforehand *when* you´re going to do something, you´re much more likely to do it. [p.129]

#### Experiment 6: Time Blocking

## Chapter 5: Find Courage

> The good thing about amygdala is that it helps us survive. If we didn´t have that part of our brain urging us to avoid tigers and snakes and high-speed vehicles, the human species might not have lasted this long. The bad news is that the amygdala can also identify perceived but illusory threats. Researchers call this *amygdala hijack*. It´s what happens when the amygdala tells us to avoid and flee, even when there´s no serious threat to our safety. [p.136]
