## Introduction



> **Deep Work**:  Professional activities performed in a state of mind that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. ==These efforts create **new value**, **improve your skill**, and are **hard to replicate**.== [p. 3]

> **Shallow Work**: Non-cognitively demanding, logistical style tasks, often performed while distracted. ==These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate==. [p. 6]

> **Deep Work Hypothesis**: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly **rare** at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly **valuable** in our economy. As a consequence, ==the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive==. [p. 24]




# Part 1: The Idea

## Chapter 1: Deep Work is Valuable
**The High Skilled Workers**
> Nate Silver, of course, with his comfort in feeding data into large databases, then siphoning it out into his mysterious Monte Carlo simulation, is the epitome of the High Skilled Worker. Intelligent machines are not an obstacle to Silver´s success, but instead its precondition. [p. 24]

**The Superstars**
> [...] "Hearing a succession of mediocre singers does not add up to a single outstanding performance." In other words, talent is not a commodity you can buy in bulk and combine to reach the needed levels: There´s a premium to being the best. [p. 25-26]

**The Owners**

### How to become a Winner in the New Economy

> **Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy**
> 1. The ability to quickly master hard things
> 2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed. [p. 29]

> The point of providing these details is to emphasize that intelligent machines are complicated and hard to master. To join the group of those who can work well with these machines, therefor, requires that you hone your **ability to master hard things**. And because these technologies change rapidly, this process of mastering hard things never ends: You must be able to do it quickly, **again and again**. [p. 31]

> This provides another general observation for joining the ranks of winners in our economy. **If you don´t produce, you won´t thrive** - no matter how skilled you are. [p. 32]

> The two core abilities just described depend on your ability to perform deep work, [p. 32]

### Deep Work Helps You Quickly Learn Hard Things

> [...] deliberate practice [...] It´s core components are usually identified as follows: 
> 1. your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you´re trying to master. 
> 2. you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it´s most productive. [p. 34-35]

> The reason therefore, why it´s important to focus intensely on the task at hand while avoiding distraction is because this is the only way to isolate the relevant neural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination. [p. 36-37]
> 
> To learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely without distraction. ==To learn, in other words, is an act of deep work.== [p. 37]

### Deep Work Helps You Produce at an Elite Level

> Law of productivity:
> High Quality Work Produced =
> (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus) [p. 40]

> [...] attention residue [...] This residue gets especially thick if your work on Task A was unbounded and of low intensity before you switched, but even if you finish Task A before moving on, your attention remains divided for a while. [p. 42-42]

> That quick check [to email inbox] introduces a new target for your attention. Even worse, by seeing messages you cannot deal with at the moment (which is almost always the case), you´ll be forced to turn your back to the primary task with the secondary task left unfinished. [p. 43]

> the type of work that optimizes your performance is deep work. [p. 44]

### What about Jack Dorsey

> On the other hand, it also tells as that you cannot extrapolate the approach of executives to other jobs. The fact that Dorsey encourages interruption or Kerry Trainor checks his e-mail constantly doesn´t mean you´ll share their success if you follow suit: Their behaviours are characteristic of their specific roles as corporate officers. [p. 47]

## Chapter 2: Deep Work is Rare
### The Metric Black Hole
> The Result: He discovered that Atlantic Media was spending well over a million dollars a year to pay people to process e-mails, with every message sent or received tapping the company around ninety-five cents of labour costs. "A free and frictionless' method of communication," Cochran summarized, "had costs equivalent to procuring small company Learjet". [p.54]

> And even then, the outcome is fungible, as it´s not able to separate out, for example, how much value was produced by this frequent, expensive e-mail use to offset some of its cost. [p.55]

> [...] metric black hole [...] None of these behaviours would survive long if it was clear that they were hurting the bottom line, but the metric black hole prevents this clarity and allows the shift towards distraction we increasingly encounter in the professional world. [p. 56]

### The Principle of Least Resistance

> The Principle of Least Resistance: in a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviour to the bottom line, we will tend towards behaviours that are easiest at the moment. [p. 58]

> If you work in an environment where you can get an answer to your question or a specific piece of information immediately when the need arises, this makes your life easier - at least, in the moment. [p.58]

> The second reason that a culture of connectivity makes life easier is that it creates an environment where it becomes acceptable to run your day out of your inbox -responding to the latest missive with alacrity while others pile up behind it, all the while feeling satisfyingly productive. [p. 59]

> The principle of Least resistance, protected from scrutiny by the metric black hole, supports work cultures that save us from the short-term discomfort of concentration and planning, at the expense of long-term satisfaction and the production of real value [p.60]

### Busyness as Proxy for Productivity

> A similar reality creates problems for many knowledge workers. They want to prove that they´re productive members of the team and are earning their keep, but they´re not entirely clear what this goal constitutes. [p. 63]

> Business as Proxy for productivity: In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledgr workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner. [p. 64]

> Knowledge work is not an assembly line, and extracting value from information is a n activity that´s often at odds with busyness, not supported by it. [p. 65]
